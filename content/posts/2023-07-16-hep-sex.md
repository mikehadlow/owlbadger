Hepworth was a presenter of the BBC’s Old Grey Whistle Test through the late 70s and 80s and knows more than anyone about the history of rock and pop music. He’s written several books on the subject, but this is the first one of his I’ve read. It’s the story of how an unlikely collection of British bands in the mid-60s to mid-70s dominated US popular music. Spearheaded by the Beatles, but followed by a whole host of others, many of who were far more popular in the US than they ever were back home. I’d barely heard of the Dave Clarke Five, but apparently they were second only to the Beatles in the US! Full of titillating gossip, groupies and rock star bad behaviour, it was a very enjoyable light read.
