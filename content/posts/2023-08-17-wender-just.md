A funny, self-depreciating, and very honest account of being a teenage girl in the 80s and a Britpop star in the 90s. It’s all the more poignant for me because this was very much my era too - Wender is just a year younger. Very good on the negative sides of the music business, the hypocrisy of the “indie” antiestablishmentarianism, the rush of fame followed by an equally swift demise, the encounters with the other groups of the time, especially the individual members of Blur, and the ubiquitous and persistent groupies that followed the bands around. Very lightly and attractively written, a real joy. Also helped that I once had dinner with her husband and Sleeper drummer, Andy Maclure.
