I’ve really enjoyed it. A superb read. I don’t think there was much in it that was entirely new to me, and it was largely preaching to the converted. I’ve been fascinated by the ideas of evolutionary psychology for some time now. It provides a very convincing and scientific explanation for much of human behaviour. Why men are different from women, why we mate and have sex the way we do, and why we so readily form groups and work together so well. However, the most interesting part of the book for me was the second part which considered cultural evolution; applying darwinian ideas to our ever more complex culture. This made it a very good follow on from Joe Heinrich’s WEIRD book. The idea of “the selfish meme” as a kind of parasite on human brains is a very powerful one. Even more interesting is the idea that co-evolution of genes and memes might explain such things as language, music, art, and religion. That a really powerful idea, although still very speculative at this stage. It was a shame that he didn’t really make a stong point that the evolution of culture is as big an inflection point as photosynthesis, the eukaryotic cell, or even gene based life itself. There’s obviously a plausible future where culture will become independent of genes (with AGI), expand into the galaxy and entirely superseded gene based evolution.
