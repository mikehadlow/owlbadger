A very well produced and written book, full of her excellent photos. It reads like a who’s who of early 20th century art with Man Ray and Piccasso all playing large parts. Lee Miller herself comes through it all as a most extraordinary character: model, photographer, adventurer, reporter, and world class cook. Geographically it ranges from her US childhood and modelling career to Paris in the 20s and 30s, Egypt in the 30s, Europe at war in the 40s, and a familiar gentle post war Sussex. The war years are probably the most dramatic when she worked as Vogue’s war correspondent, following the US army into France soon after D-Day and then through Europe into Germany where she witnessed the concentration camps and the destruction of Hitler’s Bavarian hide out. Astonishing how packed a life it was. There’s no doubt it she had her demons, including a very difficult relationship with her son the author, but the overall impression is of an outstanding larger than life character. Very enjoyable, and I’m now more than keen to revisit Farley Farmhouse when the opportunity arises.
