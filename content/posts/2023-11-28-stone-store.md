A very good biography of Jeff Bezos and his creation, Amazon. Very interesting about Bezos’s childhood and upbringing; the story of how his biological father lost all contact and knowledge of him until Brad Stone hunted him down could be from a novel. Bezos is a unique and exceptional character, although not so dissimilar from other tech founders such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. All have laser focussed vision and drive towards a higher goal that often has little to do with personal enrichment or status. All are unpleasant characters who are often not pleasant to work with and drive their employees hard in a high stress environment. I’d personally hate to work in one of those fulfilment centres, it sounds like a nightmare. It’s very interesting how Bezos constantly repeats the same set of aphorisms and heuristics that have become embedded in the culture. I would have liked a more technical author in places, especially in the chapter on AWS, which I don’t think got the write up it deserves. On the whole though a fascinating book.
