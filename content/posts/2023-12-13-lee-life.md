The last chapter finished with a very moving account of their last gig followed by Neil Peart’s retirement and then untimely death of brain cancer. He very ably describes how after being united in making music with the same two guys for 40 years it all came to a very sad and abrupt stop. It’s a very well written book, a cut above the average rock memoir, and is almost two books in one with extraordinary story of his parents survival in the Nazi death camps of WWII worth a book in its own right. The arc of his mother’s life from teenage concentration camp inmate to mother of one of the world’s biggest rock stars is quite hard to comprehend. The book is above all a story of friendship between the three members of the band, and especially between Lee and Lifeson, who have been the closest buddies since their high school years, and still now meet up regularly to drink their way through Lee’s wine collection. All three of them come out of the book with clearly defined personalities, but Lifeson is the most attractive, a jokey, stoned, cuddly, guitar virtuoso, always ready to chat to fans, and able to put up with Lee’s “bossypants” personality for 40 years. I’m still chuckling to myself about his tour pseudonym Mike Oxonfire.
