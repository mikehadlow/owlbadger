The tale of a JET program participant dumped into very rural Yamagata straight from university in the UK, and then over the next ten years succeeding as the biggest Japan YouTuber. It’s a great story with lots of quirky characters on the way; a chain smoking anglophile, a peacenik teacher, a random drunken night with a girl from Taiwan. He’s a very engaging, self depreciating, narrator. It’s definitely at its best at the beginning describing his JET years and then reads as if he’d got a little bored of writing towards the end. As a former JET myself it was a very familiar story, and the fact that he’d settled in Sendai made it even more poignant. For the first time in two decades I found myself thinking how nice it would be to travel to Japan again.
