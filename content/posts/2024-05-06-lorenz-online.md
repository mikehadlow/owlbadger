 It’s an excellent overview of the first quarter century of social media, from the early days of blogging in the 90’s through MySpace, then Twitter and Facebook, and finally onto TikTok. Fascinating because it’s also a personal history. I was a D-list tech blogger in the 2000s and 2010s, and an early and enthusiastic user of Twitter. Also my main source of entertainment has been YouTube for at least the last 15 years. The only big trend I seem to have missed is TikTok, but I see the effect of that secondhand through Yuna, who is glued to it for several hours a day. Lorenz is very good about the “creator economy” and the way it’s evolved to where it now rivals traditional media. She illustrates this with some lively potted biographies of chosen creators. She gives a balanced view of both the good, the bad, the excesses, and the burnout, but is occasionally rather US-progressive in her attitudes, blaming the relatively poorer showing of black creators/influencers as the result of deliberate “exploitation” rather than simple market forces. But that’s a minor gripe; overall, very well written and researched and an easy and enjoyable read.
