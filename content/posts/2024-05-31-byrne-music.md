 A rather hit-and-miss book. Some sections were very interesting. I especially enjoyed the ones about how you get paid in the music business, or rather how it worked in the late 20th C. and how to “make a scene”. Some excellent interesting reflections on how the scene around CBGBs evolved in the late 70s and early 80s. Also very good were his personal reflections on making Talking Heads albums and taking them on tour, and the thought process behind them. I’m not a huge fan of Talking Heads, I always found the music rather repetitive and uninteresting, although there’s no doubt that David Byrne is a unique and talented vocalist and lyricist. It’s often more “performance art” than music as such, if that makes any sense? Unfortunately much of the book was just random philosophical musing that I find quite irritating. The last chapter, a riff on what the essence of music really is, was especially waffly and I ended up skimming over most of it. So some very good bits, but could have done with some heavy editing.
