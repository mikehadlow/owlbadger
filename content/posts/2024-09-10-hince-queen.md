Peter "Ratty" Hince was Freddie Mercury and John Deacon’s roadie through the 70’s and 80’s. A rollicking fun filled tale of life on the road with one of the world’s biggest bands. Rather than a simple narrative, it has chapters named for locations. Ratty describes the joys and temptations of each place as well as their dangers and annoyances. America, London, Japan. Everywhere they party, drink, get wasted, and attempt to usher groupies back to their rooms. Apart from Freddie Mercury’s well know gay love life, he doesn’t say anything about the other members of Queen’s escapades. Brian and Roger are only mentioned in passing. The main character is Freddie: brillant, excessive, sometimes violently pissed off. John Deacon is also much discussed. He comes across as a quiet nice guy gradually becoming more and more disillusioned by the lifestyle. He seems to have been the member of the band most friendly with Hince. All in all a fun light read.
