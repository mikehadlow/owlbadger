I have no idea, it was just a spare domain I had lying around.

So I found myself discussing music a lot on the book of faces, and thought to myself, “why am I feeding the beast with content when I could have my own little space on the web?” So here it is, Owlbadger, where I can exhibit my unabashed opinions about music, books, or anthing else that takes my fancy.

I hope you enjoy it.

Mike
