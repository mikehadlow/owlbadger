Released in October 2016, this is the first album by the Lemon Twigs. The creation of the teenage D'Addario brothers, Brian and Michael,
it's a work of quite astonishing precociousness.

Influences from the classic past of pop and rock run strongly throughout the record, but it's not a pastiche. The inspiration is obvious
but the execution is unique and creative. Possibly being so young, and not hindered by any thoughts of what they _should_ be doing,
they've entirely indulged themselves, throwing whatever sounded right into a richly textured matrix.
