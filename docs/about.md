I have no idea, it was just a spare domain I had lying around.

So I found myself discussing music a _lot_ on the book of faces, and thought to myself, "why am I feeding the beast with content when I
could have my own little space on the web?" So here it is, Owlbadger, where I can exhibit my unabashed opinions about music
both old and new.

I hope you enjoy it.

Mike
