Although his profession was that of an attorney, his real passion in life was fast living. Especially, as a young man, partying, drinking, and women. Lots of women. The memoirs are very touching, because he constantly laments his bad behaviour, and especially the disappointment of his beloved father, but he simply can?t stop himself from ?dissipation?; constantly falling in with the worst kind of company, and he can never turn down a professional lady. Some his excesses are hilariously funny, such as the time his sisters dressed him as a nun and then took him to a party where he became abominably drunk and raucous, while the wits around him tut-tutted at such bad behaviour from a lady of God. It?s a superb insight into the underside of Georgian London, and the life that could be had if one had a little money, the right friends, and avoided the ubiquitous STDs. Hickey, after several failed attempts, finally finds fortune practicing as an attorney in Bengal with the East India Company. He returns to London, where he spends the fortune over several years, then returns to India with his wife Charlotte on an 18 month voyage from hell, which features them nearly shipwrecked in a monsoon hurricane, and then captured by the French. It?s notable how large a part of the memoirs are devoted to life at sea. Poor Charlotte died soon after arriving in Calcutta, and Hickey then took up with an Indian women who later also died, this time from childbirth. He eventually retired at age 58 and returned to England where he settled quietly in Buckinghamshire for the next two decades until his death in 1830. He doesn?t comment much at all on Indian culture, and appears to take little interest in it, which is a shame. The Indian sections of the book are in many ways the least interesting. It?s the debauched living in London that?s the real treat, and that make this volume such a classic.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-03-05hickey-rake/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2020-09-16-the-decadent-herbs/>The Decadent Herbs</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong>The year I spent as a full time wanna be rock star.</strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Sep 16, 2022</em></div></div><p><p>It was 1985, I was twenty years old and just back from nine months volunteering in India.

It covers, what I’m calling their ‘early classic period’, the albums: The Yes Album, Fragile, Close to the Edge and Yessongs. This is when the band produced much of their best work.

Late Classic Period</a></li></ul><p>This is the first in a series of Owlbadger guides, where we look at the work of one band or artist with a critical and opinionated eye. The idea is that someone unfamiliar with their work has an insight into where to start, what to spend time on and, more importantly, what to ignore; this is information that’s difficult to glean from an impartial source such as Wikipedia and is especially important with a band such as Yes, with a career spanning decades and an output that ranges dramatically in style and quality. There’s the added complication that some of their most commercially successful work is music that Owlbadger fans will heartily dislike. It’s easy to be mislead into thinking that Yes are simply awful 80’s MOR if all you’ve heard is ‘Owner of a Lonely Heart’, and that would be a great shame because, as I hope to show, Yes music from their early to mid 70’s era is one of the most glorious artifacts of the golden age of rock.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2019-10-19-yes-1/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2018-07-09-awaken-my-love/>Awaken My Love!</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong>Wonderful 2016 funk experiment by Childish Gambino</strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Jul 9, 2018</em></div></div><p><p>&ldquo;Awaken, My Love!&rdquo; is the 2016 studio album by Donald Glover, under his stage name Childish Gambino.

The building itself looked like a large victorian house facing a tarmac playground. Opposite the school building was a world war two air raid shelter. I vaguely remember it being used for storage. Around the back of the building was a garden which we were expressly forbidden to enter. Across the road was some woodland and then the sports field. We were allowed to play in the woodland during the lunchtime break, it seemed huge to me as a small boy. I remember kicking large mounds of fallen leaves around and endless games of British Bulldog. The playing fields had a football pitch with a running track around it and there were some apparatus on the far side including a frame with ropes, that I never managed to climb to the top of.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2012-01-06-seal-st-lawrence/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br></ul></div></div></div></section></body><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",()=>{const e=Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(".navbar-burger"),0);e.length>0&&e.forEach(e=>{e.addEventListener("click",()=>{const t=e.dataset.target,n=document.getElementById(t);e.classList.toggle("is-active"),n.classList.toggle("is-active")})})})</script></html>
