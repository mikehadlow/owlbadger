I finished it in just four days, which might be a record. Palin is, as you’d expect, an excellent and engaging writer, and he effortlessly relates the life of his Edwardian ancestor. It’s indeed fascinating to follow the journey of a very ordinary man thrust in extraordinary events; from his time as a trainee clerk on Indian Railways at the hight of the British Empire, and then as failed junior manager in the Assam tea plantations. He seems to have finally settled down as a farmhand in New Zeeland for a couple of years before being caught up in WWI, joining the NZ army and seeing action, first in Gallipoli, where he was lucky to survive, then in France, and finally the battle of the Somme, where his luck ran out. Born into a wealthy and prosperous family and given a public school education. He had every opportunity in life. The fact that he failed in India, and then wound up as a farm hand in NZ, leads one to suspect that his Indian foreman was correct when he described him as “lacking intelligence”. Only after several years of army service did he rise above the rank of private and become a lance corporal. His diary entries, which form the backbone of the book are very basic lists of letters arriving and his movements from place to place. There’s almost no reflection or contemplation of what it all meant. Palin has to turn to other diarists who were present at the time to fill out the details. There seems to be something of Forest Gump about him however, in that he stoically endures the hardships of war in Turkey and France, with little complaint, and seems to have made an excellent soldier. Palin’s description of his final movements in the Somme leading up to his death are very moving. It must have been quite dramatic to finally discover the field where one’s great uncle lost his life to a German bullet.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-04-15-palin-harry/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-04-10-hastings-catastrophe/>Book Review: Catatrosphe</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong>Europe goes to war 1914</strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Apr 10, 2025</em></div></div><p><p>Published in 2014 on the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI, this is Max Hastings’ overview of the beginning of WWI from the assassination of Franz Ferdinand to the first Christmas of the war at the end of 1914. This was one of the volumes I picked from my grandfather John’s bookshelf after he died. His father, my great-grandfather, fought in WWI on the Western Front. I have his campaign medals. So there’s a family connection with the story. Hastings’ is a prolific historian of 20th C. war. I’ve read several of his books before. He writes in an engaging style, explaining grand strategy and the wide sweep of events, while at the same time weaving in individual lives and their personal reactions from being swept up by war. It is truly a terrible tale of unimaginable hubris and folly on the part of the statesmen who willed the war to happen. Hastings is in no doubt that the blame lies fully with first the Austrians for kicking the whole thing off, and then very much the Germans for both cheering them on and then launching their own attack on France. He’s dismissive of view that Britain should have stayed out of it, saying that it would have been very bad for Britain to have a continent dominated by an aggressively militaristic Germany. Of course, without being able to re-run history we’ll never know. On the battlefield it’s clear that nobody expected that the modern technologies of machine guns and long-range high-explosive artillery would give defenders such a huge advantage, and that the front would inevitably congeal into a bloody, muddy, killing machine that simply ground up soldiers by the thousands. It’s a testament to human resilience that most were able to endure it. The contrast between the jingoistic celebration by many at the outbreak, and the grim desperate reality of the trenches is stark. A lesson for all times. War is never glamorous or glorious, but sometimes must be endured.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-04-10-hastings-catastrophe/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-03-05-hickey-rake/>Book Review: Memoirs of a Georgian Rake</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong></strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Mar 5, 2025</em></div></div><p><p>William Hickey, born in 1749 into Anglo-Irish gentry, lived through the height of the Georgian renaissance during the reign of George III. Although his profession was that of an attorney, his real passion in life was fast living. Especially, as a young man, partying, drinking, and women. Lots of women. The memoirs are very touching, because he constantly laments his bad behaviour, and especially the disappointment of his beloved father, but he simply can’t stop himself from “dissipation”; constantly falling in with the worst kind of company, and he can never turn down a professional lady. Some his excesses are hilariously funny, such as the time his sisters dressed him as a nun and then took him to a party where he became abominably drunk and raucous, while the wits around him tut-tutted at such bad behaviour from a lady of God. It’s a superb insight into the underside of Georgian London, and the life that could be had if one had a little money, the right friends, and avoided the ubiquitous STDs. Hickey, after several failed attempts, finally finds fortune practicing as an attorney in Bengal with the East India Company. He returns to London, where he spends the fortune over several years, then returns to India with his wife Charlotte on an 18 month voyage from hell, which features them nearly shipwrecked in a monsoon hurricane, and then captured by the French. It’s notable how large a part of the memoirs are devoted to life at sea. Poor Charlotte died soon after arriving in Calcutta, and Hickey then took up with an Indian women who later also died, this time from childbirth. He eventually retired at age 58 and returned to England where he settled quietly in Buckinghamshire for the next two decades until his death in 1830. He doesn’t comment much at all on Indian culture, and appears to take little interest in it, which is a shame. The Indian sections of the book are in many ways the least interesting. It’s the debauched living in London that’s the real treat, and that make this volume such a classic.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-03-05-hickey-rake/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-11-12-kipling-tales/>Book Review: Twenty-One Tales</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong></strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Nov 12, 2024</em></div></div><p><p>This is a very attractive Folio Society volume of Kipling short stories that span his entire career. It one of the many Folio volumes that I’ve recently liberated from my late Dad’s collection. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything of Kipling’s before, which is an oversight, since he’s one of Sussex’s most famous authors, and I’ve been to his house, Batemans, many times. Half of the stories, and Kipling’s career, are set in the India of the British Raj, and are the most colourful, exotic, and historically interesting. The Man Who Would Be King is of course the most famous of these, a glorious tale of imperial entrepreneurship and hubris. But there’s also Without Benefit of Clergy, a tender tale of a tragic interracial love affair, In the Rukh, the first appearance of Mowgli before The Jungle Book. The rest of the stories are set in Edwardian and early 20th C. Britain. There’s the pathetically touching semi-autobiographical Baa Baa Black Sheep about the cruelty of sending small children away from their parents to school in England. My Son’s Wife, a very modern feeling story of an urban sophisticate seduced by the conservative pleasures of the countryside. It could almost be the inspiration of Blur’s Country House. And then there’s A Madonna of the Trenches, a very moving story of shell-shock and ghosts set in the trenches of WWI, where of course Kipling’s son lost his life. Sometime the Victorian wordiness gets a little tiring, and I gave up on one story, written in 19th C. soldier’s slang, as just too much like hard work. But when Kipling’s good he’s very good and on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed this volume.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-11-12-kipling-tales/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-10-20-reich-who/>Book Review: Who We Are And How We Got Here</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong>Ancient DNA and the new science of the human past</strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Oct 20, 2024</em></div></div><p><p>The book describes the revolution currently taking place in archeology thanks to the technology of ancient DNA sampling. It reveals a rich pattern of human dispersal and mixing over the past 100,000 years. In the very distant past it shows that there was interbreeding with Neaderthals and Denisovans, making us non-Africans something of a hybrid. There’s even some suggestion that Eurasian features like lighter skin might be inherited from them. In the more recent past it clears up some archeological disputes about whether cultural change in the archeological record is due to copying or population movement. It seems it’s almost always the latter. Also differences in Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA ancestry shows that in many cases males from the incoming population mated with females from the existing one. This is especially true of the Yamnaya people of the central European steppe who spread into northern Europe and South Asia around 4,000 years ago bringing indo-European languages, horses, and the wheel. It really is incredible to think of all the people struggling to survive over millennium, moving from place to place and fighting each other for dominance. How we are all the descents of a long line of survivors. Reich writes very well. It’s a very practical book that lays out the discoveries in a matter-of-fact style. He’s obviously very touchy about any association with theories of racial superiority, and explains at length how his discoveries do not support some of the more lurid online claims made about them. I thought his appeal to liberal ideas about individual equality regardless of one’s genetic inheritance was very good, and an excellent antidote to both right-wing racial supremacists and woke identity politics. This is a very exciting field. Reich describes how we might soon see a complete historical atlas of human movement and evolution. I expect he’ll have to write another book in a few years time with the updates.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-10-20-reich-who/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2020-09-16-the-decadent-herbs/>The Decadent Herbs</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong>The year I spent as a full time wanna be rock star.</strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Sep 16, 2022</em></div></div><p><p>It was 1985, I was twenty years old and just back from nine months volunteering in India.

Late Classic Period</a></li></ul><p>This is the first in a series of Owlbadger guides, where we look at the work of one band or artist with a critical and opinionated eye. The idea is that someone unfamiliar with their work has an insight into where to start, what to spend time on and, more importantly, what to ignore; this is information that’s difficult to glean from an impartial source such as Wikipedia and is especially important with a band such as Yes, with a career spanning decades and an output that ranges dramatically in style and quality. There’s the added complication that some of their most commercially successful work is music that Owlbadger fans will heartily dislike. It’s easy to be mislead into thinking that Yes are simply awful 80’s MOR if all you’ve heard is ‘Owner of a Lonely Heart’, and that would be a great shame because, as I hope to show, Yes music from their early to mid 70’s era is one of the most glorious artifacts of the golden age of rock.</p></p><p><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2019-10-19-yes-1/><em>Read more...</em></a></p></div></div></li><br><li class=card><div class=card-content><div class=content><p class=is-size-4><a href=https://owlbadger.com/posts/2018-07-09-awaken-my-love/>Awaken My Love!</a></p><div class=level><div class=level-left><strong>Wonderful 2016 funk experiment by Childish Gambino</strong></div><div class=level-right><em>Jul 9, 2018</em></div></div><p><p>&ldquo;Awaken, My Love!&rdquo; is the 2016 studio album by Donald Glover, under his stage name Childish Gambino.

We were allowed to play in the woodland during the lunchtime break, it seemed huge to me as a small boy. I remember kicking large mounds of fallen leaves around and endless games of British Bulldog.
