&lt;p>So I found myself discussing music a lot on the book of faces, and thought to myself, “why am I feeding the beast with content when I could have my own little space on the web?” So here it is, Owlbadger, where I can exhibit my unabashed opinions about music, books, or anthing else that takes my fancy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Great Uncle Harry</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-04-15-palin-harry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-04-15-palin-harry/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was a very light and entertaining little book. I finished it in just four days, which might be a record. Palin is, as you’d expect, an excellent and engaging writer, and he effortlessly relates the life of his Edwardian ancestor. It’s indeed fascinating to follow the journey of a very ordinary man thrust in extraordinary events; from his time as a trainee clerk on Indian Railways at the hight of the British Empire, and then as failed junior manager in the Assam tea plantations. He seems to have finally settled down as a farmhand in New Zeeland for a couple of years before being caught up in WWI, joining the NZ army and seeing action, first in Gallipoli, where he was lucky to survive, then in France, and finally the battle of the Somme, where his luck ran out. Born into a wealthy and prosperous family and given a public school education. He had every opportunity in life. The fact that he failed in India, and then wound up as a farm hand in NZ, leads one to suspect that his Indian foreman was correct when he described him as “lacking intelligence”. Only after several years of army service did he rise above the rank of private and become a lance corporal. His diary entries, which form the backbone of the book are very basic lists of letters arriving and his movements from place to place. There’s almost no reflection or contemplation of what it all meant. Palin has to turn to other diarists who were present at the time to fill out the details. There seems to be something of Forest Gump about him however, in that he stoically endures the hardships of war in Turkey and France, with little complaint, and seems to have made an excellent soldier. Palin’s description of his final movements in the Somme leading up to his death are very moving. It must have been quite dramatic to finally discover the field where one’s great uncle lost his life to a German bullet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Catatrosphe</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-04-10-hastings-catastrophe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-04-10-hastings-catastrophe/</guid><description>&lt;p>Published in 2014 on the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI, this is Max Hastings’ overview of the beginning of WWI from the assassination of Franz Ferdinand to the first Christmas of the war at the end of 1914. This was one of the volumes I picked from my grandfather John’s bookshelf after he died. His father, my great-grandfather, fought in WWI on the Western Front. I have his campaign medals. So there’s a family connection with the story. Hastings’ is a prolific historian of 20th C. war. I’ve read several of his books before. He writes in an engaging style, explaining grand strategy and the wide sweep of events, while at the same time weaving in individual lives and their personal reactions from being swept up by war. It is truly a terrible tale of unimaginable hubris and folly on the part of the statesmen who willed the war to happen. Hastings is in no doubt that the blame lies fully with first the Austrians for kicking the whole thing off, and then very much the Germans for both cheering them on and then launching their own attack on France. He’s dismissive of view that Britain should have stayed out of it, saying that it would have been very bad for Britain to have a continent dominated by an aggressively militaristic Germany. Of course, without being able to re-run history we’ll never know. On the battlefield it’s clear that nobody expected that the modern technologies of machine guns and long-range high-explosive artillery would give defenders such a huge advantage, and that the front would inevitably congeal into a bloody, muddy, killing machine that simply ground up soldiers by the thousands. It’s a testament to human resilience that most were able to endure it. The contrast between the jingoistic celebration by many at the outbreak, and the grim desperate reality of the trenches is stark. A lesson for all times. War is never glamorous or glorious, but sometimes must be endured.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Memoirs of a Georgian Rake</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-03-05-hickey-rake/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-03-05-hickey-rake/</guid><description>&lt;p>William Hickey, born in 1749 into Anglo-Irish gentry, lived through the height of the Georgian renaissance during the reign of George III. Although his profession was that of an attorney, his real passion in life was fast living. Especially, as a young man, partying, drinking, and women. Lots of women. The memoirs are very touching, because he constantly laments his bad behaviour, and especially the disappointment of his beloved father, but he simply can’t stop himself from “dissipation”; constantly falling in with the worst kind of company, and he can never turn down a professional lady. Some his excesses are hilariously funny, such as the time his sisters dressed him as a nun and then took him to a party where he became abominably drunk and raucous, while the wits around him tut-tutted at such bad behaviour from a lady of God. It’s a superb insight into the underside of Georgian London, and the life that could be had if one had a little money, the right friends, and avoided the ubiquitous STDs. Hickey, after several failed attempts, finally finds fortune practicing as an attorney in Bengal with the East India Company. He returns to London, where he spends the fortune over several years, then returns to India with his wife Charlotte on an 18 month voyage from hell, which features them nearly shipwrecked in a monsoon hurricane, and then captured by the French. It’s notable how large a part of the memoirs are devoted to life at sea. Poor Charlotte died soon after arriving in Calcutta, and Hickey then took up with an Indian women who later also died, this time from childbirth. He eventually retired at age 58 and returned to England where he settled quietly in Buckinghamshire for the next two decades until his death in 1830. He doesn’t comment much at all on Indian culture, and appears to take little interest in it, which is a shame. The Indian sections of the book are in many ways the least interesting. It’s the debauched living in London that’s the real treat, and that make this volume such a classic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>George III</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-02-07-roberts-george/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2025-02-07-roberts-george/</guid><description>&lt;p>I read Andrew Roberts’ biography of Churchill a few years ago which I very much enjoyed. This similar sized book on George III is just as readable and interesting, and very much a education for me because I know relatively little about the history of the late 18th C. George’s reign stretched from 1760 to 1820, but he was incapacitated for much of the last 10 years, so the core of the book deals with his active engagement with events between 1760 and 1810. The two major historical events of this time were the American war of independence followed by the French revolution and Napoleonic era. It’s George’s reputation in the United States as a inhumane tyrant that Roberts is most keen to revise. He makes a very good case that George was the opposite; humane, educated, and most importantly a stickler for the English constitution and the place of parliament. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is the light it shines on the gradual withdrawal of the monarch from executive power during George’s reign, and the consolidation of the prime minister as the lead political actor in the British system. Roberts writes very well and there are some very entertaining moments, such as a very funny line on an MP called George Gordon, a well known libertine, who had called the Archbishop of Canterbury ‘The Whore of Babylon’. “A wit commented that Gordon had finally met a whore he didn’t like”. One of the tragedies of the story is George’s opposition to catholic emancipation, which if it had been enacted would have allowed Ireland to become an equal member of the united kingdom. Instead the exclusion of much of the population from public life simply fermented resentment of the English, which only worsened throughout the rest of the 19th C. and lead to the tragic civil war and partition. One would have thought that the British establishment might have learnt something from the American independence movement and acted to re-empt separatist sentiment by giving ground early. Unfortunately not. The book gives lots of anecdotal flavour of the late 18th C. and I’m eager to read more about that era. I might try Andrew Roberts’ own Napoleon biography in the near future. All in all an excellent read. I’m very glad I made time for it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>End Times</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-12-02-turchin-end/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-12-02-turchin-end/</guid><description>&lt;p>Peter Turchin is the founder of a new kind of scientific history named “cliodynamics”. He and his team have collected a vast database of historical data: on populations, economic statistics, epidemics, laws, and heath data. It covers most of the world over an extended time period. From this he derives testable scientific theories about history. The focus of this book is his theory of “elite overproduction and popular immiseration”, which says that throughout history there is a tendency for elites to extract ever more surplus from the working class, which becomes immiserated in the process, while the elite expands until there too many “elite candidates” for the elite roles on offer. The frustrated aspirants then mobilise the immiserated and ripe-for-revolution masses to destabilise the state and cause a collapse. This slims down the size of the elite, and often the population as a whole and allows the cycle to repeat itself. In pre-industrial societies the cycle is Malthusian, with over population leading to famines and epidemics that cull the numbers, but in the modern era he says the mechanism is the strength of the “wealth pump”, and how efficiently it pumps wealth to the elite. The book focuses on the USA, which he thinks is now due a revolution or civil war. Prescient with Trump returning to the Whitehouse. Do I buy it? He makes a very persuasive case, especially for pre-industrial societies, but I’m not so convinced about his diagnosis of the US. His model fails to account for business innovation and the overall growth of the economic pie. He only cares how it’s cut. While he admires Denmark and Austria, they are hardly engines of world economic growth like the US. It’s all a bit too Marxist for me. I do think the idea of “elite overproduction” is a useful one though. Who knows whether his predictions about the future of the US turn out to be true. I rather hope not because they are quite apocalyptic!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Queen As It Began</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-11-21-smith-queen/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-11-21-smith-queen/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is probably one of most badly written books I’ve read in a very long time. It’s only because I wanted to know the history of the band that I stuck with it. It’s not just badly written, but it’s also a fawning hagiography, that feels more like a vapid press release from Brian May’s office than critical and intelligent assessment of the band. On the one hand there’s too much detail; almost every gig and recording session is listed, but without any critical assessment. There’s nothing about the music, or what the band members thought of the music, or any disagreements they might have had. The characterisation of the main players is cardboard; you don’t get any sense of them as fully rounded people. There’s so much rock star excess and ego ignored. It would have made for a fantastic story if only the authors had the guts to tell it. If only Queen had a Philip Norman or Ian Leslie to write about them. I guess my own assessment of them as a band hasn’t changed, I still think they were one of the most talented group of musicians ever to come together, who made four excellent, world class, rock albums up to A Night At The Opera, but then settled into a rut of releasing perfectly crafted top 10 singles along with uninspired and mostly filler albums.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twenty-One Tales</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-11-12-kipling-tales/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-11-12-kipling-tales/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a very attractive Folio Society volume of Kipling short stories that span his entire career. It one of the many Folio volumes that I’ve recently liberated from my late Dad’s collection. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything of Kipling’s before, which is an oversight, since he’s one of Sussex’s most famous authors, and I’ve been to his house, Batemans, many times. Half of the stories, and Kipling’s career, are set in the India of the British Raj, and are the most colourful, exotic, and historically interesting. The Man Who Would Be King is of course the most famous of these, a glorious tale of imperial entrepreneurship and hubris. But there’s also Without Benefit of Clergy, a tender tale of a tragic interracial love affair, In the Rukh, the first appearance of Mowgli before The Jungle Book. The rest of the stories are set in Edwardian and early 20th C. Britain. There’s the pathetically touching semi-autobiographical Baa Baa Black Sheep about the cruelty of sending small children away from their parents to school in England. My Son’s Wife, a very modern feeling story of an urban sophisticate seduced by the conservative pleasures of the countryside. It could almost be the inspiration of Blur’s Country House. And then there’s A Madonna of the Trenches, a very moving story of shell-shock and ghosts set in the trenches of WWI, where of course Kipling’s son lost his life. Sometime the Victorian wordiness gets a little tiring, and I gave up on one story, written in 19th C. soldier’s slang, as just too much like hard work. But when Kipling’s good he’s very good and on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed this volume.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who We Are And How We Got Here</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-10-20-reich-who/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-10-20-reich-who/</guid><description>&lt;p>The book describes the revolution currently taking place in archeology thanks to the technology of ancient DNA sampling. It reveals a rich pattern of human dispersal and mixing over the past 100,000 years. In the very distant past it shows that there was interbreeding with Neaderthals and Denisovans, making us non-Africans something of a hybrid. There’s even some suggestion that Eurasian features like lighter skin might be inherited from them. In the more recent past it clears up some archeological disputes about whether cultural change in the archeological record is due to copying or population movement. It seems it’s almost always the latter. Also differences in Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA ancestry shows that in many cases males from the incoming population mated with females from the existing one. This is especially true of the Yamnaya people of the central European steppe who spread into northern Europe and South Asia around 4,000 years ago bringing indo-European languages, horses, and the wheel. It really is incredible to think of all the people struggling to survive over millennium, moving from place to place and fighting each other for dominance. How we are all the descents of a long line of survivors. Reich writes very well. It’s a very practical book that lays out the discoveries in a matter-of-fact style. He’s obviously very touchy about any association with theories of racial superiority, and explains at length how his discoveries do not support some of the more lurid online claims made about them. I thought his appeal to liberal ideas about individual equality regardless of one’s genetic inheritance was very good, and an excellent antidote to both right-wing racial supremacists and woke identity politics. This is a very exciting field. Reich describes how we might soon see a complete historical atlas of human movement and evolution. I expect he’ll have to write another book in a few years time with the updates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Line in the Sand</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-10-04-barr-sands/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-10-04-barr-sands/</guid><description>&lt;p>This has been a fascinating read. A story of imperial arrogance and hubris followed by nemesis. The British and French manoeuvring against each other for geo-political gain after the fall of the Ottoman empire. Literally drawing a straight line on a map to divide up the Levant between them with no regard or consultation with the inhabitants. It’s thanks to this that we have the modern countries of Israel, Jordan, and Iraq from the British zone, and Lebanon and Syria from the French. At least the British had the late imperial method of installing local kings for the most part and cultivating influence rather than directly ruling. Only in Palestine did they run the administration. The French on the other hand behaved like despots from a century before and quickly alienated the arab and christian populations of Lebanon and Syria, which led to their expulsion in 1945. Britain and the Free French, despite being allies in WWII, conspired against each other consistently by harbouring and funding resistance groups in each other’s territories. Both ultimately undermining each other. The Jews played the best game, first posing as a useful compliant counterbalance to Arab demands in Palestine, and then turning to brutal terrorism combined with an effective political campaign to force the British to agree to partition. The interesting counterfactual is what would have happened if Britain had given the Arabs independence after WWI as promised and promoted by T E Lawrence? Would a “Greater Syria” have held together? James Barr writes very well. His little biographies of the major players give the story a very human dimension, with just the right amount of detail to keep the action moving along. Altogether a very enlightening read about this cursed part of the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Queen Unseen</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-09-10-hince-queen/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-09-10-hince-queen/</guid><description>&lt;p>Peter &amp;ldquo;Ratty&amp;rdquo; Hince was Freddie Mercury and John Deacon’s roadie through the 70’s and 80’s. A rollicking fun filled tale of life on the road with one of the world’s biggest bands. Rather than a simple narrative, it has chapters named for locations. Ratty describes the joys and temptations of each place as well as their dangers and annoyances. America, London, Japan. Everywhere they party, drink, get wasted, and attempt to usher groupies back to their rooms. Apart from Freddie Mercury’s well know gay love life, he doesn’t say anything about the other members of Queen’s escapades. Brian and Roger are only mentioned in passing. The main character is Freddie: brillant, excessive, sometimes violently pissed off. John Deacon is also much discussed. He comes across as a quiet nice guy gradually becoming more and more disillusioned by the lifestyle. He seems to have been the member of the band most friendly with Hince. All in all a fun light read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tales of the South Pacific</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-08-31-mich-pacific/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-08-31-mich-pacific/</guid><description>&lt;p>What a fantastic collection of stories. Certainly one of the most enjoyable books I’ve read in a while, and a rare fiction read for me. Read into that what you will. Although the stories are fictional, they are based on Mitchener’s experiences in the US navy in WWII. Perhaps because it was written directly after the war it feels very fresh, immediate, and real. The characters talk and act like 1940’s Americans because that’s what Mitchener was when he wrote it. Each chapter is a separate short story, usual around 10 to 20 pages long, and an easy half hour read. Each stands by itself, but locations and characters appear and reappear, the most notable being the “hero”, Tony Fry, but there are various others in including the French plantation owner who cycles through native wives, and the SeeBee Luther Billis. There are some that deal with fierce battles with the Japanese, but they are the minority. My favourites were both early on in the book: The Cave, about bravery and courage, and Milk Run; no better description ever made of the American’s overwhelming superiority in industrial machinery, as a significant proportion of the available airpower is deployed to save one downed pilot. But mostly the stories deal with the monotony and boredom of remote posts on small islands with little in the way of entertainment. A surprisingly number deal with sex and romance, either actual or frustrated by distance. The longest story in the book, Fo’ Dolla’, describes an intense romance between a Vietnamese girl and a marine officer. Worthy of Emily Bronte in its descriptions of a passionate doomed love affair and the idiocy of the young officer. Poignantly, he turns up again in the last chapter as the name on a headstone. Throughout we are treated with wonderful poetic descriptions of the natural beauty of the islands. The palm trees, volcanoes, and endless coral. It’s fair to say that I’m somewhat obsessed with WWII, and the Pacific campaign is particularly fascinating thanks to the immense distances and the exotic landscape over which it was fought. I really enjoyed Ian Toll’s magnificent three-volume history, and it was reading that which led me to buy Tales of the South Pacific. A thread I’m glad I pulled on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Impossible Monsters</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-08-15-taylor-monsters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-08-15-taylor-monsters/</guid><description>&lt;p>The book opens with Bishop Ussher’s calculation of the age of the earth. Drawing from biblical and classical sources he estimated that creation occurred on the 23rd October 4004 BC. It ends with current estimates of 4 billion years, calculated by the radioactive decay of uranium trapped in zircon crystals into lead. In between it charts the incredible story of how science gradually replaced christianity as the arbiter of truth amongst the elite establishment of Europe. It’s full of colourful personalities, from Mary Anning hunting for fossils on the Jurassic Coast, to Charles Darwin circumnavigating the globe, and onto the fierce and bitter rivalry between Richard Owen and Thomas Huxley, whose monumental buildings, The Natural History Museum and Imperial College, still square off against each other across Exhibition Road in Kensington. The book doesn’t say it, but it struck me that it describes not only the replacement of religion by science, but more fundamentally the replacement of a static epistemology of biblical authority with a darwinian one: survival of the fittest theory; from a thing to a process. So beautifully meta that the theory of evolution, devised to explain the history of the natural world, also explains the methodology used to derive it. The book also begs the question, that isn’t answered, of why the establishment orthodoxy was so successfully replaced. What was different about 19th C. Britain that allowed it to happen? Why there and then, and why not at any other point in history?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultrasociety</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-07-19-turchin-ultra/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-07-19-turchin-ultra/</guid><description>&lt;p>The book is based around the premise that the growth in scale and complexity of human societies - to today’s “ultra-societies” - is the result of inter-group military competition over a scale of many thousands of years. Somewhat contradictory, the growth of larger scale co-operation and harmony within societies has enabled them to more successfully compete militarily with other societies. Societies are defeated unless they also adopt better cultural practices to promote group trust and cooperation. Societies that cannot compete are simply wiped out, or dominated. The arguments tie in very nicely with the books by Steve Stewart Williams and Joe Heinrich that I’ve read recently on group-level cultural evolution, although neither of them considered war as the central driver of change.. It would be depressing if the result of all this is the discovery that societies go “backwards” towards less cooperation and egalitarianism in the absence of conflict. Turchin’s ultimate project is a “science of history” - a science of social and cultural evolution with the ultimate promise of practical policies that governments can enact to foster social harmony. A very thought provoking book, and very well written too. I’m keen to read some more by him now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Elizabeth</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-07-11-hinton-liz/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-07-11-hinton-liz/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a very “female” history; fitting I suppose for a female monarch. Hilton spends a lot of words on how Elizabeth dressed and behaved. The central theme being that she was both a woman, but also a prince in the masculine sense of the renaissance era in which she lived. Very interesting on the iconography and propaganda of her reign, and very good on her relationships with her various advisors and courtiers, and how she indulged handsome and charming young men with few other talents, the prime example being Lord Essex. I would have liked to have learnt more about historical era; the society and economics of Elizabethan England, and especially about the beginnings of English sea power, but all that is barely mentioned. The Armada is delt with in a couple of paragraphs. So not the most engaging history book I’ve read, but it kept me engaged until the end and I’m glad I persevered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fire of the Dragon</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-06-16-williams-fire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-06-16-williams-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>What an excellent overview of China’s evolution into the planet’s prime threat to peace. Williams’ obviously has an agenda, and that’s to demonstrate that the era of engagement with China is over, and the world needs to urgently move to containment. In his telling we are already in a new cold war, and the sooner the West wakes up to that fact the safer we’ll be. What’s obvious throughout is how stupidly counterproductive China’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy has been. In short order they’ve alienated most of the world against them through bullying and arrogance. How not to make friends and influence people! The book is very good on how China’s aggressive and confrontational behaviour plays out in different parts of the world, from the Himalayas to the South China Sea, but most dramatically in the Taiwan Straight. William’s thinks we’re in a similar situation to Germany’s rise before WWI. It’s all quite scary and one very much hopes that cooler heads prevail in Beijing and we’re really heading for another global conflict.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Music Works</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-05-31-byrne-music/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-05-31-byrne-music/</guid><description>&lt;p>A rather hit-and-miss book. Some sections were very interesting. I especially enjoyed the ones about how you get paid in the music business, or rather how it worked in the late 20th C. and how to “make a scene”. Some excellent interesting reflections on how the scene around CBGBs evolved in the late 70s and early 80s. Also very good were his personal reflections on making Talking Heads albums and taking them on tour, and the thought process behind them. I’m not a huge fan of Talking Heads, I always found the music rather repetitive and uninteresting, although there’s no doubt that David Byrne is a unique and talented vocalist and lyricist. It’s often more “performance art” than music as such, if that makes any sense? Unfortunately much of the book was just random philosophical musing that I find quite irritating. The last chapter, a riff on what the essence of music really is, was especially waffly and I ended up skimming over most of it. So some very good bits, but could have done with some heavy editing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Extremely Online</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-05-06-lorenz-online/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-05-06-lorenz-online/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s an excellent overview of the first quarter century of social media, from the early days of blogging in the 90’s through MySpace, then Twitter and Facebook, and finally onto TikTok. Fascinating because it’s also a personal history. I was a D-list tech blogger in the 2000s and 2010s, and an early and enthusiastic user of Twitter. Also my main source of entertainment has been YouTube for at least the last 15 years. The only big trend I seem to have missed is TikTok, but I see the effect of that secondhand through Yuna, who is glued to it for several hours a day. Lorenz is very good about the “creator economy” and the way it’s evolved to where it now rivals traditional media. She illustrates this with some lively potted biographies of chosen creators. She gives a balanced view of both the good, the bad, the excesses, and the burnout, but is occasionally rather US-progressive in her attitudes, blaming the relatively poorer showing of black creators/influencers as the result of deliberate “exploitation” rather than simple market forces. But that’s a minor gripe; overall, very well written and researched and an easy and enjoyable read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Civilization</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-04-23-clarke-civ/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-04-23-clarke-civ/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s been a very enlightening and entertaining read. Although he says it’s about western civilization in the broadest sense, it’s more accurately a history of art. Clarke knows his art and has very strong opinions about it. There’s no post-modern revisionism here; no doubts at all that western culture is the best. I found it quite charming and refreshing. Unfortunately he’s also got strong opinions about things he doesn’t know much about at all, such as science, technology, politics, and economics, and his observations on them are all a bit “man in pub”. It’s made even more ridiculous by the book being over 55 years old, and all his pronouncements about the cultural wasteland of the late 60’s made rather comic in the light of our current appraisal; that it was something of a cultural flowering. The art is wonderful though, and his descriptions and placement of the various famous artists in their place and period makes it a very good overview of 1500 years of European culture. I learnt a lot. The beautiful Folio binding and printing made it a tactile pleasure to read&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The BBC</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-04-06-hendy-bbc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-04-06-hendy-bbc/</guid><description>&lt;p>An excellent and very well written account of how the BBC has grown and evolved over the last 100 years. I especially liked the early chapters about its foundation in the early 20’s following WWI and how it firmly established its reputation as the gold standard in news and reporting during WWII. A constant thread are the battles to stay independent of government and retain balance in news reporting, when it’s the government that sets the licence fee and thus the BBC’s budget. Also good on the constant push and pull between entertainment and popularity verses it’s mission to educate and improve. It ended on a rather depressing note with the horrible scandal of Jimmy Savile, and the controversy over the Blair government’s dodgy dossier - I don’t think either Blair or Alistair Cambell have every correctly atoned for that appalling chapter. I feel a bit guilty now about my own anti-BBC prejudices that I held for a long while.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Abroad In Japan</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-02-29-broad-japan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-02-29-broad-japan/</guid><description>&lt;p>The tale of a JET program participant dumped into very rural Yamagata straight from university in the UK, and then over the next ten years succeeding as the biggest Japan YouTuber. It’s a great story with lots of quirky characters on the way; a chain smoking anglophile, a peacenik teacher, a random drunken night with a girl from Taiwan. He’s a very engaging, self depreciating, narrator. It’s definitely at its best at the beginning describing his JET years and then reads as if he’d got a little bored of writing towards the end. As a former JET myself it was a very familiar story, and the fact that he’d settled in Sendai made it even more poignant. For the first time in two decades I found myself thinking how nice it would be to travel to Japan again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Blue Arena</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-02-04-spurdle-blue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2024-02-04-spurdle-blue/</guid><description>&lt;p>What an epic tale! Bob Spurdle joined the Royal New Zeeland Air Force at the beginning of WWII and was immediately put on a boat to the UK and into the battle of Britain flying a Spitfire. He was a member of Sailor Malan’s famous squadron all through the battle and into 1941. He then took a job as a rocket catapult launched convoy fighter pilot on a couple of trips across the Atlantic, but managed to avoid action both times. Back in the UK he had a period as a recon pilot flying Spitfires over the French coast, but then return to the NZ and on to the Solomon Islands where he took part in the Guadalcanal battle. Very critical of the way the RNZAF was run, he returned the UK and became squadron leader flying the brand new Tempest during the D-Day landing and advance through France. If all this wasn’t enough, at the end of the war he volunteered as forward fighter director with the army and entered Germany in a tank. Many scenes of heartache as close friends perished, and disgust at the wonton destruction of war, but at the same time a cold blooded killer himself, interspersed with much humour and the joy of flying. Strong opinions about the various organisations he served (the RAF superb, the RNAZF woeful, the USAAF big and stupid - with disturbing tales of friendly fire) and the planes he flew (Spitfire and Tempest superb, the Hurricane an old crate, and the P40 a brick). It’s quite astonishing that he survived it all. He settled down after the war to life of business back at home in NZ and never flew a plane again. Engagingly written and very moving in places, an extraordinary tale that needed no embellishment. I thoroughly enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pax</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-12-14-holland-pax/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-12-14-holland-pax/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got about half way through this and given up for now.

From Revolver onwards he was the primary mix engineer for all the Beatles records through to the White Album when he quit before coming back to engineer Abbey Road. He brilliantly describes the mechanics of making records in the 1960s, and the personalities of the individual Beatles and their methods of song writing and performing. They must have been under immense pressure throughout that period, and there are some excellent descriptions of fans invading Abbey Road desperate for a glimpse of the fab four. It seems the pressures, and especially drug use in Lennon’s case caused their friendships to fray and eventually fall apart. It’s quite sad to read how he became more and more dysfunctional and chaotic. Why is it that great talent is often accompanied by a self destructive personality? There are also lots of very funny moments in the book, my favourite occurred during the Abbey Road sessions. The Beatles were always weirdly possessive about their food. They wouldn’t share anything with Emerick or George Martin, or even with each other. One day Yoko Ono, who was a constant presence in the studio at that time wondered across the studio and helped herself to one of George Harrison’s digestive biscuits. “Oi! The bitch is eating my biscuits!” He swore, triggering a huge row with Lennon. It’s just hilarious, but shows how fractious their relationships had become by that stage. All in all a very entertaining read, especially for a Beatles fan like me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Just For One Day</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-08-17-wender-just/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-08-17-wender-just/</guid><description>&lt;p>A funny, self-depreciating, and very honest account of being a teenage girl in the 80s and a Britpop star in the 90s. It’s all the more poignant for me because this was very much my era too - Wender is just a year younger. Very good on the negative sides of the music business, the hypocrisy of the “indie” antiestablishmentarianism, the rush of fame followed by an equally swift demise, the encounters with the other groups of the time, especially the individual members of Blur, and the ubiquitous and persistent groupies that followed the bands around. Very lightly and attractively written, a real joy. Also helped that I once had dinner with her husband and Sleeper drummer, Andy Maclure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overpaid, Oversexed, And Over There</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-07-16-hep-sex/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-07-16-hep-sex/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hepworth was a presenter of the BBC’s Old Grey Whistle Test through the late 70s and 80s and knows more than anyone about the history of rock and pop music. He’s written several books on the subject, but this is the first one of his I’ve read. It’s the story of how an unlikely collection of British bands in the mid-60s to mid-70s dominated US popular music. Spearheaded by the Beatles, but followed by a whole host of others, many of who were far more popular in the US than they ever were back home. I’d barely heard of the Dave Clarke Five, but apparently they were second only to the Beatles in the US! Full of titillating gossip, groupies and rock star bad behaviour, it was a very enjoyable light read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twilight of the Gods</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-07-08-toll-gods/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-07-08-toll-gods/</guid><description>&lt;p>Twilight of the Gods, the third volume of Ian Toll&amp;rsquo;s Pacific War trilogy. It covers the last year of the war including the naval battles around the Philippines including the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The reconquest of the Philippines with harrowing descriptions of utterly depraved behaviour of the Japanese army in Manila. The amphibious attacks on Iwo Jima and the final climatic battle of the war, the invasion of Okinawa. It concludes with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. Toll’s descriptions of the battles are incredibly gripping and include lots of first hand reporting. He’s quite graphic in his drawing of the horrors of the intense battles on confined islands and the almost inconceivable lengths the Japanese went to fight to the very last man in most cases. The horrors for the poor civilians caught up in the maelstrom are also described in tragic detail. As in the first two volumes he provides very good descriptions of the home fronts in both the US and Japan, and the political and strategic leadership of both sides. Throughout there’s a clear distinction between the US’s methodical application of clear strategy and overwhelming industrial capacity against Japanese magical and wishful thinking and prioritising avoiding shame over practical strategic and tactical thinking. The suicidal way they threw away their largest battleship the Yamato in the battle for Okinawa is perfect example of this. As with Nazi Germany, inevitable defeat was clear for over a year (probably two) before final nemesis, but the leadership could not, or would not admit it, and as a result caused more than a million unnecessary deaths. I have hugely enjoyed the whole trilogy. I thought Toll was very fair and generous for a US writer. He didn’t reduce the Japanese to mindless fascist automations but draws them as fully human, while at the same time condemning where condemnation is justified. I felt that he rather liked Yamamoto for example. The writing is excellent, more of a page turning thriller than a work of history, perhaps because the history itself is so gripping. I do love a good WWII history and these have been some of the best.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Conquering Tide</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-05-28-toll-tide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-05-28-toll-tide/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part two of his three volume history of the pacific war. The book covered the middle war period, from the middle of 1942 through to the end of 1944 and encompasses the Solomon Islands campaign through to the Marianas invasion. The fundamental story is of US production overwhelming any hope of the Japanese ever prevailing. The battles became more and more one sided as the years passed, culminating in the massacre of the Marianas Turkey Shoot. Toll gives terrific blow-by-blow descriptions of all the major operations, weaving in first hand accounts from diaries and memoirs of the participants on both the American and Japanese sides, but there are also in depth backgrounds on the political landscape in both countries and interesting interludes on other aspects of the war, such as the effects of large numbers of US servicemen in Australia, the cruises of an American submarine, the Wahoo, and the strange jungle life of a lone Australian observer behind the Japanese lines in the Solomons. He even handedly describes the hatred and racism employed by both sides and the awful inhumanity of the fighting - much like the Eastern Front in Europe than, for example, the Western Desert campaign in North Africa. The awful tragedy of Japanese women and children committing suicide on Saipan rather than surrender to the Americans is a case in point. Toll is an excellent writer and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the series so far. Now looking forward to reading the final, and by far the largest volume, Twilight of the Gods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pacific Crucible</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-04-22-toll-pacific/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-04-22-toll-pacific/</guid><description>&lt;p>A real page turner. I do love a good WWII history. I haven’t enjoyed a book as much for quite a while and have been spending an hour or more every evening with it. He expertly zooms out to explain the big political and strategic picture, but can then zoom in to an individual pilot or sailor in action at Midway or in the Coral Sea. Wonderful descriptions of navigating aircraft over the vast Pacific Ocean followed by the horrors of fighting raging fires in the hanger deck of a bombed and torpedoed carrier. He gives a fascinating and salutary account of the Japanese descent into militarism and brutality. The horrible effects of national exceptionalism, “we will win because we have a stronger fighting spirit”, that led a whole generation being thrown into a horrific and unwinnable war. Now very much looking forward to the next two volumes of the trilogy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On The Road</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-03-23-ker-road/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-03-23-ker-road/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve finished part 1, the first 100 pages. I enjoyed it, but I would have enjoyed it far more as a young man yearning for adventure. It’s a young man’s book. That devil may care, “do it for the story”, attitude, to hitch across the United States, pick up a job where you can, find friends and lovers on the way. It would have appealed hugely to me in my late teens or 20’s. Now I just think it sounds like too much work. Why struggle? Why the hunger and depravation? Much better to have a comfortable house and money to spare. I’m an old square now, set in my ways, and comfortable with the same old routines. I can see why it’s a classic and why it changed so many people’s lives, but not for me, not now. Maybe I’ll pick it up again sometime in the future and finish it off?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Discovery of Tahiti</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-02-28-robert-tahiti/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2023-02-28-robert-tahiti/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s a lovely slim Folio Society volume, illustrated with some very nice wood engravings and beautifully printed. It came with a slip case, like all Folio books. I picked it up in one of the second hand bookshops in town. It was very enjoyable. What a joy to read a first hand account of the initial encounter between 18th century English sailors and the people of Tahiti. At first it was quite hostile. The Tahitians attacked and tried to take the ship, but with only stone age weapons, they were easily driven off by muskets and canonfire with serious losses. However, after that inauspicious start relations soon became much more friendly with much trading and even more famously sexual relations between the young women and the sailors. It seems that there was no stigma in prostitution in Tahitian society and the girls were even encouraged by their families to have sex with the sailors in return for iron nails, which they greatly coveted. Robertson is a very sympathetic, and relatively impartial witness, and often shows much empathy for the islanders. It’s a little repetitive at times, a bit like my diary, but it relates the daily rhythm of life for the sailors on the island. It seems that many were very sad to leave when the time came.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Decadent Herbs</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2020-09-16-the-decadent-herbs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2020-09-16-the-decadent-herbs/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was 1985, I was twenty years old and just back from nine months volunteering in India.

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is the first in a series of Owlbadger guides, where we look at the work of one band or artist with a critical and opinionated eye. The idea is that someone unfamiliar with their work has an insight into where to start, what to spend time on and, more importantly, what to ignore; this is information that’s difficult to glean from an impartial source such as Wikipedia and is especially important with a band such as Yes, with a career spanning decades and an output that ranges dramatically in style and quality. There’s the added complication that some of their most commercially successful work is music that Owlbadger fans will heartily dislike. It’s easy to be mislead into thinking that Yes are simply awful 80’s MOR if all you’ve heard is ‘Owner of a Lonely Heart’, and that would be a great shame because, as I hope to show, Yes music from their early to mid 70’s era is one of the most glorious artifacts of the golden age of rock.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Awaken My Love!</title><link>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2018-07-09-awaken-my-love/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owlbadger.com/posts/2018-07-09-awaken-my-love/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Awaken, My Love!&amp;rdquo; is the 2016 studio album by Donald Glover, under his stage name Childish Gambino.

&lt;p>Both were built in 1865 by Horace Wilkinson to commemorate his daughter. The building itself looked like a large victorian house facing a tarmac playground. Opposite the school building was a world war two air raid shelter. I vaguely remember it being used for storage. Around the back of the building was a garden which we were expressly forbidden to enter. Across the road was some woodland and then the sports field. We were allowed to play in the woodland during the lunchtime break, it seemed huge to me as a small boy. I remember kicking large mounds of fallen leaves around and endless games of British Bulldog. The playing fields had a football pitch with a running track around it and there were some apparatus on the far side including a frame with ropes, that I never managed to climb to the top of.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
