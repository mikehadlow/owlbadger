The book doesn’t say it, but it struck me that it describes not only the replacement of religion by science, but more fundamentally the replacement of a static epistemology of biblical authority with a darwinian one: survival of the fittest theory; from a thing to a process. So beautifully meta that the theory of evolution, devised to explain the history of the natural world, also explains the methodology used to derive it.
