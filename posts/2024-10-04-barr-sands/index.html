It’s thanks to this that we have the modern countries of Israel, Jordan, and Iraq from the British zone, and Lebanon and Syria from the French. At least the British had the late imperial method of installing local kings for the most part and cultivating influence rather than directly ruling. Only in Palestine did they run the administration.

Britain and the Free French, despite being allies in WWII, conspired against each other consistently by harbouring and funding resistance groups in each other’s territories. Both ultimately undermining each other. The Jews played the best game, first posing as a useful compliant counterbalance to Arab demands in Palestine, and then turning to brutal terrorism combined with an effective political campaign to force the British to agree to partition. The interesting counterfactual is what would have happened if Britain had given the Arabs independence after WWI as promised and promoted by T E Lawrence? Would a “Greater Syria” have held together? James Barr writes very well. His little biographies of the major players give the story a very human dimension, with just the right amount of detail to keep the action moving along.
