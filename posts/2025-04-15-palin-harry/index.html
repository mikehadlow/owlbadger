He seems to have finally settled down as a farmhand in New Zeeland for a couple of years before being caught up in WWI, joining the NZ army and seeing action, first in Gallipoli, where he was lucky to survive, then in France, and finally the battle of the Somme, where his luck ran out. Born into a wealthy and prosperous family and given a public school education. He had every opportunity in life.

Only after several years of army service did he rise above the rank of private and become a lance corporal. His diary entries, which form the backbone of the book are very basic lists of letters arriving and his movements from place to place. There’s almost no reflection or contemplation of what it all meant. Palin has to turn to other diarists who were present at the time to fill out the details. There seems to be something of Forest Gump about him however, in that he stoically endures the hardships of war in Turkey and France, with little complaint, and seems to have made an excellent soldier. Palin’s description of his final movements in the Somme leading up to his death are very moving. It must have been quite dramatic to finally discover the field where one’s great uncle lost his life to a German bullet."><meta property="og:image" content="https://owlbadger.com/img/blog-image.png"><title>OwlBadger</title>
